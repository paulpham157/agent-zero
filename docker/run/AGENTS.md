# Docker Runtime Image DOX

## Purpose

- Own the runnable Agent Zero image context and local compose example.
- Install Agent Zero from a selected branch onto the base image and prepare runtime entrypoints.

## Ownership

- `Dockerfile` owns branch-based image assembly, exposed ports, and container startup command.
- `docker-compose.yml` owns the local compose service example.
- `build.txt` owns maintainer build and push command notes.
- `fs/exe/` owns runtime entrypoint, supervisor, self-update, Node eval, and service scripts.
- `fs/ins/` owns preinstall, installation, virtualenv, Playwright, SSH, and postinstall scripts.
- Files under `fs/` are copied to container root during the runtime build.

## Local Contracts

- `BRANCH` is required for branch-based Docker builds.
- Preserve exposed ports for SSH, HTTP, and tunneled services unless docs and workflows are updated together.
- Keep the two-runtime Python model aligned with the root contract.
- Do not bake secrets, local `.env` values, or user data into the image.
- Runtime startup must ensure `/a0/usr/uploads` exists before supervised services start.
- Runtime startup raises the soft open-file limit toward `A0_NOFILE_LIMIT` (default `65535`) before supervisord starts, bounded by the container hard limit.

## Work Guidance

- Keep startup scripts explicit about framework runtime versus execution runtime.
- Coordinate tag, branch, and publishing changes with GitHub workflow automation.

## Verification

- Build `docker/run` when changing Dockerfile or install scripts.
- Smoke-test container startup after entrypoint, supervisor, port, or compose changes.
