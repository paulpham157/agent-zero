# Desktop Plugin DOX

## Purpose

- Own the Agent Zero Linux desktop runtime, Xpra/Xfce session integration, and live desktop surface.

## Ownership

- `helpers/` owns desktop routes, session lifecycle, state, and prompt context.
- `api/desktop_session.py` owns desktop session API behavior.
- `hooks.py` owns route registration and plugin lifecycle hooks.
- `prompts/`, `assets/`, `skills/`, `extensions/`, and `webui/` own desktop context, assets, skill guidance, hooks, and panel UI.

## Local Contracts

- Preserve session startup, cleanup, and route protection for desktop access.
- Keep desktop state injected into prompts accurate and bounded.
- Do not expose desktop routes without the expected auth protections.
- Keep Markdown and plain text file open-with handling routed to the Editor surface through the desktop intent bridge; Desktop owns the Xfce launcher/MIME setup, while Editor owns `.md` and `.txt` editing.

## Work Guidance

- Coordinate runtime and panel changes so live UI reflects actual desktop session state.

## Verification

- Smoke-test desktop startup, panel connection, route access, and session cleanup after changes.
