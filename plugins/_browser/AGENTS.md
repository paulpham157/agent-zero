# Browser Plugin DOX

## Purpose

- Own the built-in Playwright browser tool and WebUI browser viewer.
- Bridge browser automation, page inspection helpers, and browser panel UI.

## Ownership

- `plugin.yaml` and `default_config.yaml` own metadata and browser settings defaults.
- `tools/browser.py` owns the agent-facing browser tool.
- `helpers/` owns Playwright runtime, selectors, URL helpers, extension management, and connector runtime logic.
- `api/` owns status, extension, and browser WebSocket handlers.
- `assets/`, `prompts/`, `skills/`, `extensions/`, and `webui/` own browser scripts, prompts, skill guidance, hook contributions, and UI.

## Local Contracts

- Keep browser actions safe around external pages, credentials, and user data.
- Preserve Playwright lifecycle cleanup and WebSocket viewer compatibility across regular host browsers and Electron WebContentsView embedding.
- Keep the WebUI Browser inside its own modal/canvas affordance; do not replace it with page-level navigation.
- Default the visible WebUI Browser to live CDP screencast for responsiveness. Keep lightweight CDP/DOM state snapshots as the fallback transport.
- Keep narrow WebUI Browser controls usable by grouping navigation with Annotate/settings above a full-width address bar.
- Prefer DOM/CDP browser actions with refs, selectors, frame-chain refs, and screenshots over viewport coordinate input. Coordinates remain a visual fallback.
- Do not hardcode user-specific browser paths or secrets.

## Work Guidance

- Coordinate tool, helper, and panel changes so browser state shown in the UI matches tool behavior.
- Do not depend on nested Electron `<webview>` support or launcher-specific preload bridges unless the launcher exposes that bridge as an explicit contract.
- Keep `prompts/agent.system.tool.browser.md` as a compact callable contract; move detailed browser workflows into `skills/browser-automation/SKILL.md`.
- Keep `skills/browser-automation/SKILL.md` frontmatter triggers current with rendered browsing, host-browser, screenshot, and web-interaction user phrasing so relevant-skill recall can surface the skill before the full browser workflow is needed.
- Keep fragile form guidance progressively disclosed through `skills/browser-form-workflows/SKILL.md`, linked from the browser prompt through `browser-automation`.

## Verification

- Smoke-test browser launch, navigation, DOM capture, and WebUI viewer after runtime changes.
- Run browser prompt/skill regression tests after changing browser prompt or Browser plugin skills.
